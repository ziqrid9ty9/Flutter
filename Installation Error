1. Problem: If you are seeing an error relating to licenses have not been accepted, e.g.


Solution: First make sure that you have updated Android studio to the latest version.

Next, you need to accept the Android studio licenses, see here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48604914/flutter-run-error-you-have-not-accepted-the-license-agreements



2. Problem: Error after typing flutter --version and getting "not recognized as an internal or external command" e.g.


Solution: First check that you've typed flutter --version with a space between flutter and --version.

Next, Make sure you have added the path to the flutter/bin directory correctly as seen in this video lesson at the 4 minute time mark.



3. Problem: If you are seeing an error relating to Error connecting to the service protocol. e.g.


Solution: Downgrade your Android emulator to P instead of Q.

See this link for more details: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/32696



4. Problem: If you are trying to create an Android emulator and get and error about "Intel HAXM" e.g.


Solution: You need to enable virtualisation in your BIOS. See this: https://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/

If that still doesn't work, try this: https://www.thecodecity.com/2017/01/intel-haxm-is-required-to-run-this-avd.html

Also see the discussion on the Flutter GitHub: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/33018
